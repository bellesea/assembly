Since forever ago, I’ve wanted to try writing assembly, even if just to understand why the [Rollercoaster Tycoon creator would write 99% of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=Sawyer%20wrote%2099%25%20of%20the,%2C%20rendering%2C%20and%20paint%20programs.) in it.

Embarking on this quest, I quickly found a lot of scattered and difficult to understand resources. It took compiling a bunch of different materials together to come to a high level understanding of what’s happening in my computer.

I wanted to write down my learnings and make an approachable guide for people who are new to this part of their system (like me!), including working code examples. Enjoy!

This may sound counterintuitive, but computers are actually quite simple. I know you may be shaking your head, insisting that my statement can't possibly be true, but I promise you that literally everything your computer is doing can be represented with just two values: **0** and **1**.

Now here's the catch - I said they're fundamentally simple, but I didn't say they're always easy to understand. Even though computers are, at their core, doing fairly simple tasks, they can be seriously confusing to learn about! We have to remember that computers have been built up layer by layer over a long period of time. These layers have produced the amazing, efficient, incredible machines that we use today. But, these layers also make learning about computers feel like a serious nightmare sometimes, because there's just *so much* to learn about.

Now, I will say that communicating with your CPU directly is generally quite unnecessary, as we now have higher level languages that are fast enough for most of our needs. That being said, the game [RollerCoaster Tycoon is written 99% in assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=Sawyer%20wrote%2099%25%20of%20the,%2C%20rendering%2C%20and%20paint%20programs.). Not only that, but if you're writing operating systems, doing game engine development, or working on other low level systems, you're sometimes [writing assembly directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) because you need things to be lightning fast.

Even though you or I may never _need_ to write assembly, I think that building an understanding of how your computer works at this level can be pretty dang empowering, and can help you appreciate all of the other stuff you do on your computer. In fact, the minute I wrote another program after writing in assembly, I was _so_ happy it wasn't assembly. Sorry assembly, I still love you!

I hope this guide helps you to demystify some of the lowest layers, and hopefully turn it from something that feels like magic to something that feels graspable. I personally didn’t know how these things worked before I started writing this guide, so I hope this helps you learn the things I’ve pieced together on my journey to understanding my computer better.

Alright, let's get to the good stuff. Like, what even is a CPU?

## The CPU

<p align="center">

</p>

Have you heard of the companies Intel or AMD? These are two popular companies that manufacture the CPUs that go into our computers. All of the computers we use contain something called a central processing unit, also known as the CPU or the processor, which effectively acts as the brain of the computer.

Computers contain other processing units (like the graphics card!) that are responsible for processing other more specific things, but the CPU is your general powerhouse for all computing tasks. That being said, the CPU can do shockingly little: it can **read values**, **set values**, and **perform simple math** calculations like addition and subtraction.

You hand it numbers, and it’s put to work crunching the data however you’d like. That's it. Everything your computer doing is made up of just that. Isn't that wild?

### Electricity and the physical world
The CPU is able to interpret machine code, which is just numbers, as instructions. We can represent these instructions as 1s and 0s, also known as [binary](#binary). In the physical world, we represent binary with electrical circuits. A single circuit may contain an electrical signal, or it may not. 1 represents the presence of electricity, and 0 the absence of electricity. Multiple circuits can be arranged in a group to represent binary numbers. For example, 8 circuits could be grouped together to represent a byte.

<p align="center">

  <span>just a placeholder image to break up the content!</span>
</p>


Imagine a warehouse where we are packing boxes. In this metaphor, the warehouse is your CPU, and a box is a grouping of 8 electrical signals (a byte). A single box will travel through the warehouse on conveyor belts in order to make it from one working station to another. The conveyor belts, in the CPU world, are known as buses. Buses are effectively just wires that allow electricity to travel from one place to another, and there are different types of wires depending on what kind of data you want to send around.

As a box travels around the warehouse on conveyor belts, it will be stopped at different working stations. Some stations may check inside the box and send it elsewhere based on what it finds. Other stations may add or remove stuff to or from the box. This is just like in a CPU: a byte travels around the CPU on buses, and when it reaches different parts of the CPU, it may have its value checked or modified.

In our warehouse, we want to make sure everything happens at an organized pace, and there aren't any backups at stations. One way we can accomplish this is by setting everything to a timer. Let's say our boxes move forward at the pace of 1 station per second, and each station takes 1 second to perform its task. Back in CPU land, this would be our processor clock.

Every processor has its own clock. It's not a clock that would be useful for you or me, but instead is a material that oscillates at a certain frequency, giving you a certain number of vibrations per second. These vibrations help the processor keep track of time.

This clock is going _fast_. You're seeing something like one vibration every microsecond, which is about 1000000 vibrations per second. We call each one of these vibrations a "clock tick". These are important for us because for every clock tick, the CPU reads one instruction.

### RAM
You may have heard the term “memory” thrown around when talking about computers. Usually when people use that term, they’re referring to random access memory, or RAM, which is a type of short term storage your computer has.

<p align="center">
  <br />
  <img width="460" height="300" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/03/a1/3103a18819a867fbe8b4808b4c197692.jpg">
  <br />
  <span>just a placeholder image to break up the content!</span>
</p>

Accessing your RAM is kind of like going to the post office. Each piece of data (mail, in our metaphor) has an "address" (mailbox number) where you can view the contents (mail). You can also clear out the contents (take the mail out of the box), and then store new pieces of data (get new pieces of mail).

Our pieces of mail are actually just electrical currents. Because we store data as electricity, when your computer turns off and no more electricity is traveling to it, all of the things you have stored get cleared out! It’s kind of like if every night when your post office closed, all of the mail was thrown out. That’s why we refer to it as short term memory - we want to make sure to store important things in the hard drive, which is our longer term storage, lest it be thrown away!

Our RAM, or post office, has quite a bit of room to store our things - enough to hold entire packages! But, visiting the post office and carrying mail around can be slow and cumbersome. So, for faster (but smaller) storage, we have a set of tiny mailboxes outside the post office that can just hold letters. Those are our registers.

</p>

### Registers

_NOTE: fill this section out_

Like we talked about in the [saving data](#saving-data) section, registers are available for short term data storage on the CPU.

Registers are where the CPU can store small pieces of data so that it can keep interacting with them. For example, let’s say we need to add two numbers together. First, the CPU retrieves the first number it needs for the equation. Since the CPU can really only do one thing at a time, it needs to put this number down in order to grab the next number. So it stores this first number into a register for the time being. Next, the CPU grabs the second number in the equation. The CPU now has all the information it needs to add the two numbers together. It goes ahead and executes the adding instruction, passing that new number along, and then moves on to the next instruction it’s given.

A nice thing about registers is that processors have a few of them, each one being available for different purposes. Some of them are directly accessible by you for setting values and reading values through assembly instructions, but some are used internally and can’t be directly accessed.

Now you may be asking yourself - why don’t we store everything in the registers, since memory is slower? Well, we only have a limited amount of space in our registers. The actual size depends on your computers hardware, but RAM can easily hold over 15 million times the amount that registers can! Since computers have to process so much data, we can very quickly run out of space in our registers. So any data that we need to hold onto for a bit while we calculate other things, we throw into memory. **(COMMENT 🐣: should we add an explaination of why we only have a limited number of registers? would also help with stack explaination later)**

<p align="center">
  <br />
  <img height="300" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eaSf7.jpg">
  <br />
  <span>just a placeholder image to break up the content!</span>
</p>

#### The Stack
Computers allocate a chunk of memory in the RAM to be the “stack”, a place where you can store bytes **(COMMENT 🐣: would using the term data be easier to understand? readers might not completely wrap their minds around bytes yet...)** for later use. You can do 2 things with a stack: push values onto it, which go on top of the previous values, and pop values off of it, which grabs from the top of the stack. Need something at the bottom? Too bad! You gotta go through the top.

The purpose of the stack is to store things for later. Now you might say, hey wait a minute, we use registers for that! And you’d be correct! However, we have a limited number of registers. Let’s say we are doing some complicated math, and we need to store a few amounts away for a while while we work through a problem. We can just push those values to save on the stack, and then when we’re done with that math, we can pop them off and continue like nothing ever happened. Very convenient!

So now that we know about the stack, the stack pointer is a special register the CPU has that keeps track of where the top of the stack is. So every time we push onto the stack, it automatically increments the pointer. Every time we pop off of the stack, it automatically decrements it. This pointer is actually pointing to the address of where this value lives in memory, since we have a special area of the memory sectioned off just for our stack.

Ever heard of a stack overflow? Or perhaps [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)? It’s named after this stack right here! You don’t need to know this for the purposes of this guide, but while we’re here, an overflow can happen for many reasons. One reason could be caused by accidentally writing an infinite loop, where we have a loop somewhere that never gets exited, and let's say that loop adds things onto the stack. Eventually, our stack runs out of room, and bam! Stack overflow error.

**(COMMENT 🐣: I found this section on the stack a little hard to wrap my head around... i think an explaination and example of when a stack is used could be useful. Also, do we need to discuss other parts of the RAM like the heap? I feel like this is a little too detailed for a general overview of how the CPU works haha cuz then we might need to explain memory allocation...)**

## Communicating with the CPU

One way we can communicate with the CPU is by writing instructions for it in a format called assembly language. Assembly language is the lowest level of abstraction in computers where the code you write is still human readable. You may disagree about the human readable part when you first see it, but I promise you it's better than what the computer is looking at!

What do we mean by an abstraction? Well, an abstraction is a layer above something else that makes that thing easier to do.

<p align="center">
  <br />
  <img width="460" height="300" src="https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/08.jpg">
  <br />
  <span>just a placeholder image to break up the content!</span>
</p>

For example, let's take a steering wheel. A steering wheel makes driving simple - you just turn left and right, and the amount you turn maps to how much your tires turn. But, what’s happening underneath? The steering wheel is an abstraction layer on top of rods, levers, and whatever else is happening inside that car, simplifying the act of turning for you. Or something like that. I clearly don't know anything about cars.

In our case, assembly is the steering wheel, and the rods, levers, and other hidden stuff is our machine code.

Here's the thing about computers. They can actually only understand numbers. So, machine code is just a bunch of numbers that the CPU reads to figure out what instructions to execute and on what data. It's the computer-readable code.

Since we humans like to read text, assembly is a text based language, consisting of acronyms that represent instructions to the computer. Alas, since they are text, they are not directly readable by the CPU. So that text file gets translated, through something called the assembler, into the numbers that the computer can then read.

It’s like if you have a cake recipe written in imperial measurements, and you want to convert it to metric for your Canadian friend. Line by line you’d translate the recipe until you have a new recipe for your friend to use. You’d take the first measurement, 2 cups of flour (assembly language), convert it to grams (acting as the assembler), and then write the converted recipe to use 68 grams of flour (machine code). Look at you go - you’re the assembler here!

**(COMMENT 🐣: I think this does a good job of explaining the role of an assembler but maybe a language example might be better? Cuz it technically is like two different languages? Eg. It's like if you have a cake recipe written in English (acting as the assembly language), and you want to convert it to French (acting as machine code) for your friend (acting as the computer). Line by line you’d translate the recipe until you have a new recipe for your friend to use. You’d take the first measurement in English 2, convert it to French, and write the converted recipe in French. Now your friend can understand the instructions! Look at you go - you’re the assembler here!)**

You could skip all of this assembly shenanigans by writing the machine code directly, but machine code looks something like this in binary (we will talk about [what binary is](#binary) a little bit later):

```
01000111 00000000 11110010 10101110 11110010 00000001 11000011 11100010 00001011
```

Assembly, on the other hand, looks something like:

```asm
mov r12, r13
add r12, 4
```

I know this doesn’t look extremely friendly, especially compared to the high level programming languages we have today. However, I promise you it is far friendlier than just writing a bunch of numbers!

**(COMMENT 🐣: Maybe we can move this example section + rest of the CPU explainations to above the part about assembly language and machine code,right after the paragraph about "Have you heard of the companies Intel or AMD?" and we can add a diagram. FLOW: here's a diagram with different sections of the CPU, here are different functions of individual parts, here's how they all work. After that, now here's how you can communicate with the CPU using assembly language etc.)**

All programming languages are some level of abstraction above machine code. But, in the end, all human written code has to be converted into numbers for your CPU to be able to read.  Your CPU is able to read these numbers with the help of something called a decoder.

A decoder is a specialized device on the CPU that takes input and decodes what it’s trying to do. These tasks are represented as our assembly instructions. **(COMMENT 🐣: I think we need to add brief context about how the assumbly stores instructions otherwise the following sentence is a little confusing, could be a good place for a diagram)** So the decoder sees a specific number, and it’s like oh! I know what the number 2 maps to! It means I want to subtract numbers. So now the decoder can send the data along to the right places to do the things it needs to do.

How does the decoder know how to decode these things? It’s actually built physically into the chip itself, where the circuitry determines the instruction set.

**(COMMENT 🐣: would the following section be more useful if the register was briefly explained?)**.

You may be wondering what how machine code actually works. If you are, you’re in luck! Let’s map our last `add` line to machine code. This is a completely fictional example, but it's a demonstration of how the computer decodes the numbers.

```asm
add r12, 4; Add 4 to whatever is in register 12
```

In machine code, this may end up looking like [binary](#binary), or base 2:

```
00000001 00001100 00001100 00000100
```

Which, in base 10 (how we normally talk about numbers!), is:

```
1 12 4
```

The decoder would see the first `1`, and it would know that the first number it receives should map to an instruction. Let's say instruction 1 is `add`.

The decoder knows that the `add` instruction's first argument is both:
  - the save destination
  - and the location of the first number to add

The decoder then sees that the next byte has the value `12`, so it knows that its save destination is register 12 (`r12`). It can then grab the data out of `r12` for the math part.

The decoder knows that next comes the argument for the number to add. It sees `4`, then adds `4` to whatever is in `r12`, and saves that new value to `r12`. Voila, maths!

### Writing Code
There are many different assembly languages, depending on the processor you want to talk to.

- X86 is the most useful but the hardest to write. It's used for Intel processors, which have to process a lot of data.
- 6502 is another popular assembly language, simpler than X86, and these processors are still used in many small devices today
- Z80 is another one you might know - remember those TI-8X calculators you may have used in school? Well, to program those, you'd use the Z80 assembly language!
- RISC-V

### Instructions
_Note: These examples are written in X86-64 Intel syntax assembly language_

#### Comments

```asm
  ; Note: Anything that comes after a semicolon is considered a comment.
  ;       A comment in code means that the compiler will ignore it, so you have
  ;       a place to jot down notes, TODOs, etc.
```

#### Basic math

```asm
  add rdi, 3
```

```asm
  sub rdi, 2
```

#### Jumps and Conditionals
This is not an exhaustive list, but a list of some examples of instructions to
demonstrate the kinds of conditionals assembly provides us.

A conditional is something that relies on a condition being met to execute it.

_Note: Check out http://unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html for a list of conditional jumps for X86 Intel._

##### Jump if Not Equal
```asm
  jne .placeToJump
```

##### Jump if Greater
```asm
  jg .goHere
```

##### Jump if Less
```asm
  jl .doSomeMath
```

##### Label
```asm
  _main:
    call .performAddition
    ; ret will return here and keep executing!

  .performAddition:
    add rdi, 3
    ret ; returns back to where you left off in _main!
```

##### Program counter
WRITING NOTE: Talk about how this maps to jump/call instructions in assembly

The CPU has many specialized registers, which we don't access directly. One of them is the program counter, which keeps track of what code it's executing. This register stores the memory address of the current line of the current program it's executing, and updates itself automatically. For example, let’s say we are running an assembly program. There's an instruction for adding two numbers together. Once that instruction finishes running, the program counter increments to the memory address of the next instruction of the program.

## The Math Section
If you thought you'd get through this without doing any math, well, I'm sorry. We have to do a little bit so that we can understand what the computer is doing, because like I said, it's all just basic math underneath. Now, I promise you it won't be too hard. You may get a little confused and your brain may hurt, but just stick with me here and we'll make it through to the assembly section.

### Hexadecimal
_Note: fill this out_

All numbers in assembly language are represented by hexadecimal
Our usual numbers are base 10

When you see 125 as a number, you can think of that as:
- (10 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (5 * 10^0)
- 100 + 20 + 5 = 125

Hex is base 16, which means is 0-9, A-F for 10-15

When you see 7D, you can think of that as:
- D = 13
- (7 * 16^1) + 13
- 112 + 13 = 125
- 
### Binary
<p align="center">
  <br>
  <img width="460" height="300" src="https://images.easytechjunkie.com/green-lit-numbers.jpg">
  <br>
</p>

When people hear that I program for a living, they think that I stare at 0s and 1s all day. Luckily I do not, because that would give me a migraine. However, binary is important to talk about, because everything the computer is doing can be represented by these digits. These digits are referred to as binary, which is a number system that has 2 as its base.

When we think of numbers in the human world, we think of them in base 10. Base 10 means that each digit of a number can be represented with the digits 0-9. Each digit over we move (for example 1 vs 10 vs 100) is 10 times the value to the right of it.

_Note: Finish filling this in_

### Boolean logic
Boolean is a very cute word for a very simple concept! A boolean is something that can only have one of two values - true or false. True or false can also be represented as 1 for true, 0 for false.

Since we represent data in the physical world with the inclusion or absence of electrical signals, we can use something called boolean logic to determine whether a “statement” is true or false. A statement here is just boolean values, and we pass them to operations we can use depending on our use case.

Why would we ever use this? Great question! Let me let you in on a secret - everything your computer is doing is actually just composed of these logical operations. Everything. All the math your processor can do, it’s done by combining a few of these operations together. So you send it some electrical signals, it goes through a few of these “logic gates”, in the form of transistors, and BAM! You have an answer at the end. You combine a bunch of these small answers through more transistors, and then you have a larger answer!

Let’s talk through these logical operations a bit.

#### AND

Fun fact: You only need the NAND gate (AND gate followed by NOT) to do every single possible logic operation ever. That means that every possible logic circuit can be made to use only NAND! In fact, a physical NAND transistor takes up less area than an AND transistor. To make an AND, you’d actually make a NAND and then invert the output. Check out the free course [From Nand2 to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) to build an entire computer system using just these principles.

In real circuits, you would even see amalgamations of gates (like AND+OR+NOT+OR+AND) as a single "standard cell". It’s like stacking lego bricks, but each brick is a logical operation.
